# voice_assistant
I produced this project as part of a class assignment. Python, Seleneium web, Pyttx3, 
speech recognition, and other tools were used to create it. With this project, you may ask
the voice assistant to look up information for you on YouTube or Wikipedia by speaking
to it. When prompted, the voice assistant can also read the most recent news and provide
random facts

# Running the program
1. Run main.py
2. You can modify the code to specify keywords for the programÂ to search for in the recognised speech.

# Future Improvements
1. Adding new features and capabilities to the voice assistant, such as the ability to understand and respond to
more complex commands.
2. Incorporating more sophisticated security measures, such as biometric authentication and block chain
technology, to protect user data from unauthorized access.
3. Developing a system that can learn and adapt over time, based on the user's preferences and behavior.
Integrating the system with more devices, such as cars, home appliances, and medical devices, to improve
the user experience and make the technology more widely available
