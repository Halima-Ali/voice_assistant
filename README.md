# voice_assistant
I produced this project as part of a class assignment. Python, Seleneium web, Pyttx3, 
speech recognition, and other tools were used to create it. With this project, you may ask
the voice assistant to look up information for you on YouTube or Wikipedia by speaking
to it. When prompted, the voice assistant can also read the most recent news and provide
random facts
